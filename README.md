# 📘 Posts Management System

A professional React-based frontend application designed to showcase essential patterns, principles, and features every proficient frontend developer should master. This project simulates a real-world post management interface, including search, filtering, categorization, user session mock, and responsive UI/UX components.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **React 18+** with Hooks
- **TypeScript** for type safety and scalable interfaces
- **TailwindCSS** for utility-first responsive design
- **Lucide Icons** (tree-shakable SVG)

## 📌 Core Concepts & React Patterns Demonstrated

### 🧠 React Fundamentals
- Component-driven architecture
- Controlled components (forms, filters)
- State management using `useState`
- Filtering logic via `useMemo`
- Authentication context via `React Context API`
- Component-level lazy loading via `React.lazy` + `Suspense`

### ⚙️ Performance-Oriented Practices
- Memoization of filtered results to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Dynamic imports with fallback loading skeletons (`QuickStats`)
- Minimal DOM manipulations using declarative logic

### 📦 Reusability & Structure
- Separation of concerns: isolated UI components (`PostCard`, `AddPostForm`)
- Modular folder structure (components, data, utils, types)
- Centralized constants for category/status management
- Mock authentication system with context provider

## 🎯 App Features

- Dynamic filtering & search (title, description, tags)
- Grid/List toggle view modes
- Real-time post status updates (`to-read`, `reading`, `read`)
- Like system with state toggle
- Add Post form with modal interaction
- JSON download functionality
- Featured post highlight
- Responsive layout across breakpoints
- Visual feedback via Tailwind animations & transitions


## 📁 Folder Structure Overview

src/
├── components/ # UI components (PostCard, Footer, Forms, etc.)
├── context/ # Auth context (mock auth system)
├── data/ # Dummy posts for simulation
├── utils/ # Constants and helper data
├── types/ # TypeScript types (Post, Status)
└── app.tsx # Main application logic


## ✅ Possible Improvements (Roadmap)

- Extract filtering logic to a custom hook (`useFilteredPosts`)
- Persist user data (posts, filters) to localStorage
- Add support for portal-based modals
- Integrate `useRef` and `useEffect` for side-effect logic (scroll, focus)
- Setup ESLint, Prettier, and husky hooks for team-level quality
- Extend layout to multi-page (Next.js migration ready)
